Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, managing, and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They provide a way to handle large amounts of data, making it easier to perform operations like searching, sorting, and indexing. Common types of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, each serving different purposes and offering various advantages depending on the use case.

They are fundamental in computer science and porgramming because they enable efficient data management, which is crucial for creating fast and optimized algorithms. The choice of data structure can significantly impact the performance of a program, particularly in terms of speed and memory usage. Understanding data structures allows programmers to select the best tools for solving specific problems, leading to more efficient and scalable code. In the end, data structures are the backbone of software development, enabling effective data handling and algorithm design.

1.  Types of Data Structures
    1.1. Primitive Data Structures

        Definition and examples (e.g., integers, floats, characters).
        Characteristics and usage.

1.2. Non-Primitive Data Structures

    Overview and classification.
