  "Where's your crown, King Nothing?",
  "I'm your life, and I no longer care.",
  "I rule the midnight air, the destroyer!",
  "MASTER! MASTER!",
  "Exit light, enter night.",
  "Life it seems, will fade away. Drifting further every day.",
  "Forever trusting who we are, and nothing else matters.",
  "All that is, ever, ever was, will be ever twisting, turning through the never.",
  "You can take your fucking time",
  "And though this is tragic, at least I found the end",
  "Justice is served!",
  "Of course we look back because we cannot bear to look forward",
  "And there it went, almost like your life!",
  "Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free, you jab another pin in me",
  "Can you heal what father's done? Or fix this hole in a mother's son?",
  "The more I search, the more my need for you",
  "Time was never on my side",
  "So on I wait my whole lifetime",
  "Can't stop to save my soul, I take the leash that's leading me",
  "Did you ever think I'd get lonely?",
  "Find me guilty, when true guilt is from within",
  "The brightest flame burns quickest",
  "Yeah everyone's got to have the sickness, 'Cause everyone seems to need the cure",
  "Then the unnamed feeling, it comes alive",
  "Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet!",
  "I can't see the sun from this room, but I know that its setting somewhere",
  "I can't keep checking my phone for things you won't say"
