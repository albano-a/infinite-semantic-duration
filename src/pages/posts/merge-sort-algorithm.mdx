Merge sort is a highly effective way to sort data. In many cases,
it maintains the order of equal elements from the input to the output, making it what's called a stable sort.
Merge sort is a [divide-and-conquer algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm)
that was invented by John von Neumann, at the end of World War II.

## Algorithm

A merge sort algorithm works like this:

1. Divide the unsorted list in smaller sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted);
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

There are two implementations of this algorithm, one is top-down, i.e recursive, and the other is bottom-up, i.e iterative.
But I will only show you the recursive one, as it is the most common and easier to understand.

## Pseudocode

This algorithm recursively divides the input list into smaller sublists until the sublists are trivially sorted, and then
merges the sublists while sorting them. The pseudocode is available below:

```text
function merge_sort(list m) is
    // Base case. A list of zero or one
    // elements is sorted, by definition.
    if length of m ≤ 1 then
        return m

    // Recursive case. First, divide the
    // list into equal-sized sublists
    // consisting of the first half
    // and second half of the list.
    // This assumes lists start at index 0.
    var left := empty list
    var right := empty list
    for each x with index i in m do
        if i < (length of m)/2 then
            add x to left
        else
            add x to right

    // Recursively sort both sublists.
    left := merge_sort(left)
    right := merge_sort(right)

    // Then merge the now-sorted sublists.
    return merge(left, right)
```

```text
function merge(left, right) is
    var result := empty list

    while left is not empty and right is not empty do
        if first(left) ≤ first(right) then
            append first(left) to result
            left := rest(left)
        else
            append first(right) to result
            right := rest(right)

    // Either left or right may have elements left; consume them.
    // (Only one of the following loops will actually be entered.)
    while left is not empty do
        append first(left) to result
        left := rest(left)
    while right is not empty do
        append first(right) to result
        right := rest(right)
    return result
```

## Visualization

## Implementation

### Python

<CodeBlock client:load text={`
def merge(left, right):
\tresult = []

\twhile len(left) != 0 and len(right) != 0:
\t\tif left[0] <= right[0]:
\t\t\tresult.append(left[0])
\t\t\tleft = left[1:]
\t\telse:
\t\t\tresult.append(right[0])
\t\t\tright = right[1:]

\twhile len(left) != 0:
\t\tresult.append(left[0])
\t\tleft = left[1:]

\twhile len(right) != 0:
\t\tresult.append(right[0])
\t\tright = right[1:]

\treturn result

def merge_sort(array):
\tif len(array) <= 1:
\t\treturn array

\tleft = []
\tright = []

\tfor i, x in enumerate(array):
\t\tif i < len(array) / 2:
\t\t\tleft.append(x)
\t\telse:
\t\t\tright.append(x)

\tleft = merge_sort(left)
\tright = merge_sort(right)

\treturn merge(left, right)

j = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]

print(merge_sort(j))
`} />

```python
def merge(left, right):
    result = []

    while len(left) != 0 and len(right) != 0:
        if left[0] <= right[0]:
            result.append(left[0])
            left = left[1:]
        else:
            result.append(right[0])
            right = right[1:]

    while len(left) != 0:
        result.append(left[0])
        left = left[1:]

    while len(right) != 0:
        result.append(right[0])
        right = right[1:]

    return result


def merge_sort(array):
    if len(array) <= 1:
        return array

    left = []
    right = []

    for i, x in enumerate(array):
        if i < len(array) / 2:
            left.append(x)
        else:
            right.append(x)

    left = merge_sort(left)
    right = merge_sort(right)

    return merge(left, right)


j = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]

print(merge_sort(j))
```
