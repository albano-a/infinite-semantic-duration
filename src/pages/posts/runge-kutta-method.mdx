DRAFT

One other method for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
is the Runge-Kutta method. This method is a family of iterative methods
that can be used to solve initial-value problems. The most common Runge-Kutta methods
are the 2nd and 4th order.

The way to solve these methods are very similar to the [Euler Method](/posts/euler-method-ode),
but with more precision. The 2nd order Runge-Kutta method is also known
as the midpoint method, and the 4th order Runge-Kutta method is the most 
commonly used.

The 2nd order Runge-Kutta method is given by:

<LatexCenter f="
w_{0} = \alpha \\
w_{i+1} = w_{i} + h f(t_{i} + \frac{h}{2}, w_{i} + \frac{h}{2} f(t_{i}, w_{i}))
" />

And the 4th order Runge-Kutta method is given by:

<LatexCenter f="
w_{0} = \alpha \\
k_{1} = h f(t_{i}, w_{i}) \\
k_{2} = h f(t_{i} + \frac{h}{2}, w_{i} + \frac{k_{1}}{2}) \\
k_{3} = h f(t_{i} + \frac{h}{2}, w_{i} + \frac{k_{2}}{2}) \\
k_{4} = h f(t_{i+1} + h, w_{i} + k_{3}) \\
w_{i+1} = w_{i} + \frac{1}{6}(k_{1} + 2k_{2} + 2k_{3} + k_{4})
" />

Yeah, it's a lot. Let's see an example and use the 4th Order Runge-Kutta Method,
the same from the [Euler Method](/posts/euler-method-ode):

<LatexCenter f="y' = y - t^{2} + 1; \ 0 \le t \le 2;\ y(0) = 0.5;\ h = 0.2" />

The value of <Latex f="h" /> is the step size. The interval is <Latex f="[0, 2]" />.
So, we have 10 steps. The values of t are <Latex f="t_{0} = 0.0,\ t_{1} = 0.2,\ t_{2} = 0.4, ...,\ t_{8} = 1.6,\ t_{9} = 1.8" />

Just like the Euler Method, that means we have 10 iterations. Let's begin the first two iterations

<LatexCenter f="w_{0} = 0.5" />
In the first iteration <Latex f="w_{i} = 0" /> and <Latex f="t_{i} = 0.0" />
<LatexCenter f="
w_{1}: \begin{cases}
K_{1} = 0.2 \cdot (0.5 - 0.0^{2} + 1);\ K_{1} =  0.3\\
K_{2} = 0.2 \cdot (0.5 + \frac{0.3}{2} - (0 + \frac{0.2}{2})^{2} + 1) ;\ K_{2} = 0.328 \\
K_{3} = 0.2 \cdot (0.5 + \frac{0.328}{2} - (0 + \frac{0.2}{2})^{2} + 1) ;\ K_{3} = 0.3308 \\
K_{4} = 0.2 \cdot ((0.5 + 0.3308) - (0.2)^{2} + 1) ;\ K_{4} = 0.3581 \\
\end{cases} \\
w_{1} = 0.5 + \frac{(0.3 + 2\cdot 0.328 + 2\cdot 0.3308 + 0.3581)}{6} = 0.8292
" />
<LatexCenter f="
w_{2}: \begin{cases}
K_{1} = 0.2 \cdot (0.8292 - 0.2^{2} + 1);\ K_{1} =  0.3578 \\
K_{2} = 0.2 \cdot (0.8292 + \frac{0.3578}{2} - (0.2 + \frac{0.2}{2})^{2} + 1) ;\ K_{2} = 0.3836 \\
K_{3} = 0.2 \cdot (0.8292 + \frac{0.3836}{2} - (0.2 + \frac{0.2}{2})^{2} + 1) ;\ K_{3} = 0.3862 \\
K_{4} = 0.2 \cdot ((0.8292 + 0.3862) - (0.4)^{2} + 1) ;\ K_{4} = 0.4111  \\
\end{cases} \\
w_{2} = 0.8292 + \frac{(0.3578 + 2\cdot 0.3836 + 2\cdot 0.3862 + 0.4111)}{6} = 1.2140

<LatexCenter f="\vdots" />
<LatexCenter f="
w_{10}: \begin{cases}
K_{1} = 0.2 \cdot (4.8150 - 1.8^{2} + 1);\ K_{1} =  0.5150 \\
K_{2} = 0.2 \cdot (4.8150 + \frac{0.5150}{2} - (1.8 + \frac{0.2}{2})^{2} + 1) ;\ K_{2} = 0.4925 \\
K_{3} = 0.2 \cdot (4.8150 + \frac{0.4925}{2} - (1.8 + \frac{0.2}{2})^{2} + 1) ;\ K_{3} = 0.4902 \\
K_{4} = 0.2 \cdot ((4.8150 + 0.4902) - (2.0)^{2} + 1) ;\ K_{4} = 0.4610  \\
\end{cases} \\
w_{10} = 4.8150 + \frac{(0.5150 + 2\cdot 0.4925 + 2\cdot 0.4902 + 0.4610)}{6} = 5.3053
" />

The final result is <Latex f="y_{rk}(2) = 5.3053" />. If you recall the Euler Method result is
<Latex f="y_{e}(2) = 4.8657" />.

It's clear that the Runge-Kutta Method is more precise than Euler's method. That's because
of its higher order of accuracy, which means it can provide a more accurate approximation of the solution
over a given interval. It is designed to minimize the local truncation error, which is
the error introduced at each step of the calculation. Also, higher order methods like this reduce the error
more rapidly as the step size decreases.
