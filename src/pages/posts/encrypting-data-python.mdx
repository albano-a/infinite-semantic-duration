# Introduction

Encryption is a method used to protect data by converting it into a coded format that is
unreadable to unauthorized users. This process uses algorithms to transform plaintext data into
ciphertext, which can only be deciphered by someone who has the correct decryption key. There are
two main types of encryption: symmetric encryption, where the same key is used for both encryption and
decryption, and asymmetric encryption, which uses a pair of keys -- public and private -- for these processes.

## Importance of encryption

1. **Data Security**: Encryption is very important in protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
   This includes personal DataTransfer, financial records, and confidential business information.

2. **Privacy**: By encrypting DataTransfer, individuals and organizations can ensure that their private
   information remains confidential, maintaining privacy in communications and transactions.

3. **Compliance**: Many industries are subject to regulations that require the protection of data through
   encryption. Compliance with these regulations is necessary to avoid legal consequences and maintain trust.

# Encryption Algorithms.

Encryption algorithms are the backbone of data security in our digital world. As said, these algorithms transform readable
data, known as plaintext, into an encoded format, or ciphertext, making it inaccessible to unauthorized users.
The process is reversed through decryption, restoring the original data only to those possessing the correct key. 
There are two primary types of encryption algorithms: symmetric and asymmetric.

**Symmetric encryption algorithms** use the same key for both encryption and decryption. Well-known symmetric algorithms
include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Data Encryption Standard (DES). These algorithms are generally faster
and are used in scenarios where large amounts of data need to be encrypted quickly.

**Asymmetric encryption algorithms**, on the other hand, utilize a pair of keys -- public and private. The public key is used for encryption, 
while the private key is used for decryption. This PaymentMethodChangeEvent, exemplified by algorithms like RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC 
(Elliptic Curve Cryptography), enhances security by ensuring that the decryption key remains confidential.
